/* This code is defining an enumeration type called `EnemyState` in C#. An enumeration is a set of
named integer constants. In this case, `EnemyState` has five possible values: `Default`, `Idle`,
`Patrol`, `Chase`, and `UsingAbility`. This can be used to represent the different states an enemy
character can be in within a game or application. */
