### RUIN VA BUILD V1 - README
## Personal work file locations:
* All files such as soundtracks, scripts, character models, and animations that I personaly worked on are located in the Assets folder.
* NOTE: All project files generated by Unity have been removed to save space and avoid GitHub LFS billing. The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase my programming work.
